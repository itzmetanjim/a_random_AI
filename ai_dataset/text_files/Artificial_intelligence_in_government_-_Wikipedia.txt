It can be used to furtherpublic policyobjectives in areas such as emergency services, health and welfare, as well as assist the public to interact with the government through the use ofvirtual assistants, for example. According to theHarvard Business Review, "Applications of artificial intelligence to the public sector are broad and growing, with early experiments taking place around the world."1Hila Mehr from theAsh Center for Democratic Governance and InnovationatHarvard Universitynotes that AI in government is not new, with postal services using machine methods in the late 1990s torecognise handwritingon envelopes to automatically route letters.2The use of AI in government comes with significant benefits, including efficiencies resulting in cost savings for instance by reducing the number of front office staff, and reducing the opportunities for corruption.3However, it also carries risks described below. The potential uses of AI in government are wide and varied,4withDeloitteconsidering that "Cognitive technologies could eventually revolutionize every facet of government operations".5Mehr suggests that six types of government problems are appropriate for AI applications:2 Mehr states that "While applications of AI in government work have not kept pace with the rapid expansion of AI in the private sector, the potential use cases in the public sector mirror common applications in the private sector."2 Potential and actual uses of AI in government can be divided into three broad categories: those that contribute to public policy objectives; those that assist public interactions with the government; and other uses. There are a range of examples of where AI can contribute to public policy objectives.4These include: AI can be used to assist members of the public to interact with government and access government services,4for example by: Various governments, including those of Australia10and Estonia,11have implemented virtual assistants to aid citizens in navigating services, with applications ranging from tax inquiries to life-event registrations. Gerrymanderingis an insidious method of influencing political process.12Depending on the objective of its use, the application of artificial intelligence to redraw districts based on voter distribution and demographic datasets can either contribute to impartiality, or sustain partisan gains for interested stakeholders in the election process.13 Other uses of AI in government include: AI offers potential efficiencies and costs savings for the government. For example,Deloittehas estimated that automation could saveUS Governmentemployees between 96.7 million to 1.2 billion hours a year, resulting in potential savings of between 3.3 billion to 41.1 billion a year.5TheHarvard Business Reviewhas stated that while this may lead a government to reduce employee numbers, "Governments could instead choose to invest in the quality of its services. They can re-employ workers' time towards more rewarding work that requires lateral thinking, empathy, and creativity  all things at which humans continue to outperform even the most sophisticated AI program."1 Risks associated with the use of AI in government include AI becoming susceptible to bias,2a lack of transparency in how an AI application may make decisions,7and the accountability for any such decisions.7 AI in governance and the economic world might make the market more difficult for companies to keep up with the increases in technology. Large U.S. companies like Apple and Google are able to dominate the market with their latest and most advanced technologies. This gives them an advantage over smaller companies that do not have the means of advancing as far in the digital technology fields with AI.14 TITLE: Artificial intelligence in government - Wikipedia
