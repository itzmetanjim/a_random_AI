Since the mid-2010s, many analysts have noted the emergence of such an arms race betweensuperpowersfor bettermilitary AI,12driven byincreasing geopolitical and military tensions. An AI arms race is sometimes placed in the context of anAI Cold Warbetween theUnited StatesandChina.3 Lethal autonomous weaponssystems use artificial intelligence to identify and kill human targets without human intervention.4LAWS have colloquially been called "slaughterbots" or "killer robots". Broadly, any competition for superior AI is sometimes framed as an "arms race".56Advantages in military AI overlap with advantages in other sectors, as countries pursue both economic and military advantages.7 In 2014, AI specialistSteve Omohundrowarned that "An autonomous weapons arms race is already taking place".9According toSiemens, worldwide military spending on robotics was US5.1 billion in 2010 and US7.5 billion in 2015.1011 China became a top player in artificial intelligence research in the 2010s. According to theFinancial Times, in 2016, for the first time, China published more AI research papers than the entire European Union. When restricted to number of AI papers in the top 5 of cited papers, China overtook the United States in 2016 but lagged behind the European Union.1223 of the researchers presenting at the 2017American Association for the Advancement of Artificial IntelligenceAAAI conference were Chinese.8Eric Schmidt, the former chairman ofAlphabet, has predicted China will be the leading country in AI by 2025.13 One risk concerns the AI race itself, whether or not the race is won by any one group. There are strong incentives for development teams to cut corners with regard to the safety of the system, increasing the risk of critical failures and unintended consequences.1415This is in part due to the perceived advantage of being the first to develop advanced AI technology. One team appearing to be on the brink of a breakthrough can encourage other teams to take shortcuts, ignore precautions and deploy a system that is less ready. Some argue that using "race" terminology at all in this context can exacerbate this effect.16 Another potential danger of an AI arms race is the possibility of losing control of the AI systems; the risk is compounded in the case of a race toartificial general intelligence, which may present anexistential risk.16In 2023, aUnited States Air Forceofficial reportedly said that during acomputer test, a simulated AI drone killed the human character operating it. The USAF later said the official had misspoken and that it never conducted such simulations.17 A third risk of an AI arms race is whether or not the race is actually won by one group. The concern is regarding the consolidation of power and technological advantage in the hands of one group.16A US government report argued that "AI-enabled capabilities could be used to threaten critical infrastructure, amplify disinformation campaigns, and wage war"18:1, and that "global stability and nuclear deterrence could be undermined".18:11 In 2014, former Secretary of DefenseChuck Hagelposited the "Third Offset Strategy" that rapid advances in artificial intelligence will define the next generation of warfare.19According to data science and analytics firm Govini, the U.S.Department of DefenseDoD increased investment in artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing from 5.6 billion in 2011 to 7.4 billion in 2016.20However, the civilianNSFbudget for AI saw no increase in 2017.12Japan Timesreported in 2018 that the United States private investment is around 70 billion per year.21The November 2019 'Interim Report' of the United States' National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence confirmed that AI is critical to US technological military superiority.18 The U.S. has many military AI combat programs, such as theSea Hunterautonomous warship, which is designed to operate for extended periods at sea without a single crew member, and to even guide itself in and out of port.22From 2017, a temporary US Department of Defense directive requires a human operator to be kept in the loop when it comes to the taking of human life by autonomous weapons systems.23On October 31, 2019, the United States Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Board published the draft of a report recommending principles for the ethical use of artificial intelligence by the Department of Defense that would ensure a human operator would always be able to look into the 'black box' and understand thekill-chainprocess. However, a major concern is how the report will be implemented.24 The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center JAIC pronounced "jake"25is an American organization on exploring the usage of AI particularlyedge computing,Network of Networks, and AI-enhanced communication, for use in actual combat.26272829It is a subdivision of theUnited States Armed Forcesand was created in June 2018. The organization's stated objective is to "transform theUS Department of Defenseby accelerating the delivery and adoption of AI to achieve mission impact at scale. The goal is to use AI to solve large and complex problem sets that span multiple combat systems; then, ensure the combat Systems and Components have real-time access to ever-improving libraries of data sets and tools."27 In 2023 Microsoft pitched the DoD to useDALL-Emodels to train itsbattlefield management system.30OpenAI, thedeveloperof DALL-E, removed the blanket ban on military and warfare use from its usage policies in January 2024.31 Project Maven is aPentagonproject involving using machine learning and engineering talent to distinguish people and objects in drone videos,32apparently giving the government real-time battlefield command and control, and the ability to track, tag and spy on targets without human involvement. Initially the effort was led byRobert O. Workwho was concerned about China's military use of the emerging technology.33Reportedly, Pentagon development stops short of acting as an AI weapons system capable of firing on self-designated targets.34The project was established in a memo by theU.S. Deputy Secretary of Defenseon 26 April 2017.35Also known as theAlgorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team,36it is, according to Lt. Gen. of theUnited States Air ForceJack Shanahan in November 2017, a project "designed to be that pilot project, that pathfinder, that spark that kindles the flame front of artificial intelligence across the rest of the Defense Department".37Its chief,U.S. Marine CorpsCol. Drew Cukor, said: "People and computers will work symbiotically to increase the ability of weapon systems to detect objects."38Project Maven has been noted by allies, such as Australia'sIan Langford, for the ability to identify adversaries by harvesting data from sensors onUAVsand satellite.39At the secondDefense OneTech Summit in July 2017, Cukor also said that the investment in a "deliberate workflow process" was funded by the Department of Defense through its "rapid acquisition authorities" for about "the next 36 months".40 The U.S.Department of Defenseis partnering with Ukraine on "Project Artemis" to develop advanced drones that can withstand electronic warfare, blending Ukrainian simplicity and adaptability with American precision. Due to theRussia-Ukraine war, Ukraine has emerged as a leader in drone production and warfare, creating cost-effective systems that challenge traditional approaches. Countries like Turkey, China, and Iran are also producing affordable drones, reducing America's monopoly and reshaping warfare dynamics. U.S. efforts are focused on integrating AI,drone swarmtechnology, and hybrid drone systems to maintain military dominance. The democratization of drone technology raises issues, such as autonomous decision-making, counter-drone defenses, and dual-use concerns, that challenge ethical and security norms.41 China is pursuing a strategic policy ofmilitary-civil fusionon AI for globaltechnological supremacy.1842According to a February 2019 report by Gregory C. Allen of theCenter for a New American Security,China'sleadership includingparamount leaderXi Jinping believes that being at the forefront in AI technology is critical to the future of global military and economic power competition.7Chinese military officials have said that their goal is to incorporate commercial AI technology to "narrow the gap between the Chinese military and global advanced powers."7The close ties between Silicon Valley and China, and the open nature of the American research community, has made the West's most advanced AI technology easily available to China; in addition, Chinese industry has numerous home-grown AI accomplishments of its own, such asBaidupassing a notable Chinese-language speech recognition capability benchmark in 2015.43As of 2017, Beijing's roadmap aims to create a 150 billion AI industry by 2030.12Before 2013, Chinese defense procurement was mainly restricted to a few conglomerates; however, as of 2017, China often sources sensitive emerging technology such as drones and artificial intelligence from private start-up companies.44An October 2021 report by theCenter for Security and Emerging Technologyfound that "Most of the Chinese military's AI equipment suppliers are not state-owned defense enterprises, but private Chinese tech companies founded after 2010."45The report estimated that Chinese military spending on AI exceeded 1.6 billion each year.45TheJapan Timesreported in 2018 that annual private Chinese investment in AI is under 7 billion per year. AI startups in China received nearly half of total global investment in AI startups in 2017; the Chinese filed for nearly five times as many AI patents as did Americans.21 China published a position paper in 2016 questioning the adequacy of existing international law to address the eventuality of fully autonomous weapons, becoming the first permanent member of theU. N. Security Councilto broach the issue.46In 2018, Xi called for greater international cooperation in basic AI research.47Chinese officials have expressed concern that AI such as drones could lead to accidental war, especially in the absence of international norms.48In 2019, formerUnited States Secretary of DefenseMark Esperlashed out at China for selling drones capable of taking life with no human oversight.49 The focus on "intelligentized AI warfare", pursued by China, suggests a comprehensive integration of AI across all domains land, sea, air, space, and cyber for autonomous attack, defence and cognitive warfare.50The intelligentized strategy is distinct from traditional warfare, which focuses on network-centric operations, and instead sees AI as a force multiplier that enhances decision-making, command structures, and autonomous capabilities. Unlike traditional warfare, intelligentization leverages AI to create a cognitive advantageallowing it to process battlefield information better. AI-assisted command-and-control C2 systems, predictive analytics, and real-time data fusion, enabling accelerated human-AI hybrid decision-making. Autonomous systems, including drone swarms, AI-powered cyber warfare, play a crucial role in this strategy. China is reported to be currently developing wingman drones, robotic ground forces, and optimised logistics to enhance combat effectiveness.51TheChinese army PLA also emphasisescognitive warfareusing AI-driven psychological operations, social media manipulation, and predictive behavioural analysis to influence adversaries and the importance of dynamic responses where AI enhances hacking capabilities, automated SIGINT Signals Intelligence and adaptive tactics. However, despite this focus, some analysts believe China could be struggling to fully realise AI capability within the military environment: a "comprehensive review of dozens of Chinese-language journal articles about AI and warfare reveals that Chinese defense experts claim that Beijing is facing several technological challenges that may hinder its ability to capitalize on the advantages provided by military AI"52 A task force for the Strategic Implementation of AI for National Security and Defence was established in February 2018 by theMinistry of Defense's Department of Defence Production.53The process of getting the military ready for AI use was started by theMoDin 2019.54TheCentre for Artificial Intelligence and Roboticswas approved to develop AI solutions to improveintelligence collectionand analysis capabilities.55In 2021, theIndian Army, with assistance from theNational Security Council, began operating the Quantum Lab and Artificial Intelligence Center at theMilitary College of Telecommunication Engineering. With an emphasis on robotics and artificial intelligence,Defence Research and Development OrganisationandIndian Institute of Scienceestablished the Joint Advanced Technology Programme-Center of Excellence.5657In 2022, theIndian Navycreated an AI Core group and set up a Center of Excellence for AI andBig Data analysisatINS Valsura.5859Indian Army incubated Artificial Intelligence Offensive Drone Operations Project.6061During Exercise Dakshin Shakti 2021, the Indian Army integrated AI into itsintelligence,surveillance, andreconnaissancearchitecture.62 In 2022, the Indian government established theDefence Artificial Intelligence Counciland theDefence AI Project Agency,6364and it also published a list of 75 defense-related AI priority projects.6566MoDearmarked1,000croreannually till 2026 for capacity building, infrastructure setup, data preparation, and Al project implementation.67The Indian Army, the Indian Navy and theIndian Air Forceset aside 100 crore annually for the development of AI-specific applications.68The military is already deploying some AI-enabled projects and equipment.6970At Air Force Station Rajokri, theIAFCentre of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence was established in 2022 as part of the Unit for Digitization, Automation, Artificial Intelligence, and Application Networking UDAAN.71Swarm drone systemswere introduced by theMechanised Infantry Regimentfor offensive operations close to theLine of Actual Control.72 For offensive operations, the military began acquiring AI-enabledUAVsandswarm drones.737475Bharat Electronicsdeveloped AI-enabled audio transcription and analysis software for batlefield communication. Using AI during transport operations, the Indian Army's Research  Development branch patented driver tiredness monitoring system.7677As part of initial investment, theIndian Armed Forcesis investing about 50 million 47.2 million yearly on AI, according to Delhi Policy Group.78Forhigh altitudelogisticsat forward outposts,military robotsare deployed.7980Army is developing autonomous combat vehicles, robotic surveillance platforms, and Manned-Unmanned Teaming MUM-T solutions as part of the Defence AI roadmap.81MCTEis working with theMinistry of Electronics and Information Technologyand, Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering  Research, on AI and military-gradechipset.8283Phase III of AI-enabled space-based surveillance has been authorized.8485 DRDOChairman and Secretary of the Department of Defense Research  Development Samir V. Kamat said the agency started concentrating on the potential use of AI in the development of military systems and subsystems.86The Indian government intends to leverage the private sector's sizable AI workforce anddual-use technologiesfor defense by 2026.87In order to conduct research on autonomous platforms, improved surveillance,predictive maintenance, andintelligent decision support system, the Indian Army AI Incubation Center was established.88Indian Navy launchedINS Suratwith AI capabilities.8990 Russian GeneralViktor Bondarev, commander-in-chief of the Russian air force, stated that as early as February 2017, Russia was working on AI-guided missiles that could decide to switch targets mid-flight.91TheMilitary-Industrial Commission of Russiahas approved plans to derive 30 percent of Russia's combat power from remote controlled and AI-enabled robotic platforms by 2030.92Reports by state-sponsored Russian media on potential military uses of AI increased in mid-2017.93In May 2017, the CEO of Russia's Kronstadt Group, a defense contractor, stated that "there already exist completely autonomous AI operation systems that provide the means for UAV clusters, when they fulfill missions autonomously, sharing tasks between them, and interact", and that it is inevitable that "swarms of drones" will one day fly over combat zones.94Russia has been testing several autonomous and semi-autonomous combat systems, such asKalashnikov's "neural net" combat module, with a machine gun, a camera, and an AI that its makers claim can make its own targeting judgements without human intervention.22 In September 2017, during a National Knowledge Day address to over a million students in 16,000 Russian schools, Russian PresidentVladimir Putinstated "Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind... Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world". Putin also said it would be better to prevent any single actor achieving a monopoly, but that if Russia became the leader in AI, they would share their "technology with the rest of the world, like we are doing now with atomic and nuclear technology".959697 Russia is establishing a number of organizations devoted to the development of military AI. In March 2018, the Russian government released a 10-point AI agenda, which calls for the establishment of an AI and Big Data consortium, a Fund for Analytical Algorithms and Programs, a state-backed AI training and education program, a dedicated AI lab, and a National Center for Artificial Intelligence, among other initiatives.98In addition, Russia recently created a defense research organization, roughly equivalent to DARPA, dedicated to autonomy and robotics called the Foundation for Advanced Studies, and initiated an annual conference on "Robotization of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."99100 The Russian military has been researching a number of AI applications, with a heavy emphasis on semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. In an official statement on November 1, 2017, Viktor Bondarev, chairman of the Federation Council's Defense and Security Committee, stated that "artificial intelligence will be able to replace a soldier on the battlefield and a pilot in an aircraft cockpit" and later noted that "the day is nearing when vehicles will get artificial intelligence."101Bondarev made these remarks in close proximity to the successful test of Nerehta, an crewless Russian ground vehicle that reportedly "outperformed existing crewed combat vehicles." Russia plans to use Nerehta as a research and development platform for AI and may one day deploy the system in combat, intelligence gathering, or logistics roles.102Russia has also reportedly built a combat module for crewless ground vehicles that is capable of autonomous target identificationand, potentially, target engagementand plans to develop a suite of AI-enabled autonomous systems.103104100 In addition, the Russian military plans to incorporate AI into crewless aerial, naval, and undersea vehicles and is currently developing swarming capabilities.99It is also exploring innovative uses of AI for remote sensing and electronic warfare, including adaptive frequency hopping, waveforms, and countermeasures.105106Russia has also made extensive use of AI technologies for domestic propaganda and surveillance, as well as for information operations directed against the United States and U.S. allies.107108100 The Russian government has strongly rejected any ban onlethal autonomous weaponsystems, suggesting that such an international ban could be ignored.109110 The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing Russia-Ukraine war has seen seen significant use of AI by both sides and has also been characterised as a drone war.111Advances in AI-powered GPS-denied navigation and drone swarming techniques are significantly improving operational capabilities for Ukraine. Fully realised drone swarms, where multiple drones coordinate and make decisions autonomously, are still in the early stages of experimentation but Ukraine is exploring and implementing these techniques in a real conflict situation.112The Defense Intelligence of Ukraine DIU has been at the forefront of utilizing drones with some elements of autonomy for conducting long-range strikes into Russian territory. Domestic drone production has significantly expanded, with approximately 2 million drones produced in 2024, 96.2 of which were domestically manufactured.113 Rather than replacing human involvement, AI is primarily serving to augment existing capabilities, enhancing the speed, accuracy, and overall efficiency of numerous military functions. Perhaps the most important way in which AI has been used by Ukraine is in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance ISR capabilities. The Ukrainian military uses Palantirs MetaConstellation software to monitor the movement of Russian troops and supplies highlighting the blurring of boundaries between state military and commercial AI use. It aggregates data from various commercial civilian providers of satellite imagery Ukraine also uses its own Delta system which aggregates real time data from drone imagery, satellite photos, acoustic signals, and text to construct an operational picture for military commanders. AI is used to prioritise incoming threats, potential targets and resource constraints.114 AI is also being used to process intercepted communications from Russian soldiers, to process, select, and output militarily useful information from these intercepted calls. Israel makes extensive use of AI for military applications specially during theGaza war. The main AI systems used fortarget identificationare the Gospel and Lavender. Lavender developed by the Unit 8200 identifies and creates a database of individuals mostly low-ranking militants of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and has a 90 accuracy rate and a database of tens of thousands. The Gospel in comparisons recommended buildings and structures rather than individuals. The acceptable collateral damage and the type of weapon used to eliminate the target is decided by IDF members and could track militants even when at home.115 Israel'sHarpyanti-radar "fire and forget" drone is designed to be launched by ground troops, and autonomously fly over an area to find and destroy radar that fits pre-determined criteria.116The application of artificial intelligence is also expected to be advanced in crewless ground systems and robotic vehicles such as the Guardium MK III and later versions.117These robotic vehicles are used in border defense. In 2015, the UK government opposed a ban on lethal autonomous weapons, stating that "international humanitarian law already provides sufficient regulation for this area", but that all weapons employed by UK armed forces would be "under human oversight and control".118 The South KoreanSuper aEgis IImachine gun, unveiled in 2010, sees use both in South Korea and in the Middle East. It can identify, track, and destroy a moving target at a range of 4 km. While the technology can theoretically operate without human intervention, in practice safeguards are installed to require manual input. A South Korean manufacturer states, "Our weapons don't sleep, like humans must. They can see in the dark, like humans can't. Our technology therefore plugs the gaps in human capability", and they want to "get to a place where our software can discern whether a target is friend, foe, civilian or military".119 The European Parliament holds the position that humans must have oversight and decision-making power over lethal autonomous weapons.120However, it is up to each member state of the European Union to determine their stance on the use of autonomous weapons and the mixed stances of the member states is perhaps the greatest hindrance to the European Union's ability to develop autonomous weapons. Some members such as France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden are developing lethal autonomous weapons. Some members remain undecided about the use of autonomous military weapons and Austria has even called to ban the use of such weapons.121 Some EU member states have developed and are developing automated weapons. Germany has developed anactive protection system, the Active Defense System, that can respond to a threat with complete autonomy in less than a millisecond.121122Italy plans to incorporate autonomous weapons systems into its future military plans.121 The international regulation of autonomous weapons is an emerging issue for international law.123AI arms control will likely require the institutionalization of new international norms embodied in effective technical specifications combined with active monitoring and informal diplomacy by communities of experts, together with a legal and political verification process.12As early as 2007, scholars such as AI professorNoel Sharkeyhave warned of "an emerging arms race among the hi-tech nations to develop autonomous submarines, fighter jets, battleships and tanks that can find their own targets and apply violent force without the involvement of meaningful human decisions".124125 Miles Brundage of theUniversity of Oxfordhas argued an AI arms race might be somewhat mitigated through diplomacy: "We saw in the various historical arms races that collaboration and dialog can pay dividends".126Over a hundred experts signed an open letter in 2017 calling on the UN to address the issue of lethal autonomous weapons;127128however, at a November 2017 session of the UNConvention on Certain Conventional WeaponsCCW, diplomats could not agree even on how to define such weapons.129The Indian ambassador and chair of the CCW stated that agreement on rules remained a distant prospect.130As of 2019, 26 heads of state and 21 Nobel Peace Prize laureates have backed a ban on autonomous weapons.131However, as of 2022, most major powers continue to oppose a ban on autonomous weapons.132 Many experts believe attempts to completely ban killer robots are likely to fail,133in part because detecting treaty violations would be extremely difficult.134135A 2017 report fromHarvard'sBelfer Centerpredicts that AI has the potential to be as transformative as nuclear weapons.126136137The report further argues that "Preventing expanded military use of AI is likely impossible" and that "the more modest goal of safe and effective technology management must be pursued", such as banning the attaching of an AIdead man's switchto a nuclear arsenal.137 A 2015 open letter by theFuture of Life Institutecalling for the prohibition of lethal autonomous weapons systems has been signed by over 26,000 citizens, including physicistStephen Hawking,TeslamagnateElon Musk,Apple'sSteve WozniakandTwitterco-founderJack Dorsey, and over 4,600 artificial intelligence researchers, includingStuart Russell,Bart SelmanandFrancesca Rossi.138129The Future of Life Institute has also released two fictional films,Slaughterbots2017 andSlaughterbots - if human: kill2021, which portray threats of autonomous weapons and promote a ban, both of which went viral. ProfessorNoel Sharkeyof theUniversity of Sheffieldargues that autonomous weapons will inevitably fall into the hands of terrorist groups such as theIslamic State.139 Many Western tech companies avoid being associated too closely with the U.S. military, for fear of losing access to China's market.43Furthermore, some researchers, such asDeepMindCEODemis Hassabis, are ideologically opposed to contributing to military work.140 For example, in June 2018, company sources atGooglesaid that top executiveDiane Greenetold staff that the company would not follow-up Project Maven after the current contract expired in March 2019.32 TITLE: Artificial intelligence arms race - Wikipedia
