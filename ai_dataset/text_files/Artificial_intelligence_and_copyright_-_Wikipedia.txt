Artificial intelligence and copyright Contents Copyright status of AI-generated works Training AI with copyrighted data Copyright infringing AI outputs Litigation References External links United States United Kingdom China United States EU UK India In the 2020s, therapid advancementofdeep learning-basedgenerative artificial intelligencemodels raised questions about whethercopyright infringementoccurs when such are trained or used. This includestext-to-image modelssuch asStable Diffusionandlarge language modelssuch asChatGPT. As of 2023, there were several pending U.S. lawsuits challenging the use of copyrighted data to train AI models, with defendants arguing that this falls underfair use.1 Popular deep learning models are trained on mass amounts of mediascrapedfrom the Internet, often utilizing copyrighted material.2When assembling training data, the sourcing of copyrighted works may infringe on thecopyright holder's exclusive right to control reproduction, unless covered by exceptions in relevant copyright laws. Additionally, using a model's outputs might violate copyright, and the model creator could be accused ofvicarious liabilityand held responsible for that copyright infringement. Since most legal jurisdictions only grant copyright to original works of authorship by human authors, the definition of "originality" is central to the copyright status of AI-generated works.3 In the U.S., theCopyright Actprotects "original works of authorship".4TheU.S. Copyright Officehas interpreted this as being limited to works "created by a human being",4declining to grant copyright to works generated without human intervention.5Some legal professionals have suggested thatNaruto v. Slater2018, in which theU.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appealsheld thatnon-humanscannot be copyright holders ofartistic works, could be a potential precedent in copyright litigation over works created by generative AI.6Some have suggested that certain AI generations might be copyrightable in the U.S. and similar jurisdictions if it can be shown that the human who ran the AI program exercised sufficient originality in selecting the inputs to the AI or editing the AI's output.54 Proponents of this view suggest that an AI model may be viewed as merely a tool akin to a pen or a camera used by its human operator to express their creative vision.47For example, proponents argue that if the standard of originality can be satisfied by an artist clicking the shutter button on a camera, then perhaps artists using generative AI should get similar deference, especially if they go through multiple rounds of revision to refine their prompts to the AI.8Other proponents argue that the Copyright Office is not taking a technology neutral approach to the use of AI oralgorithmictools. For other creative expressions music, photography, writing the test is effectively whether there isde minimis,or limited human creativity. For works using AI tools, the Copyright Office has made the test a different one i.e. whether there is no more thande minimistechnological involvement.9 This difference in approach can be seen in the recent decision in respect of a registration claim by Jason Matthew Allen for his workThéâtre D'opéra Spatialcreated using Midjourney and an upscaling tool. The Copyright Office stated: The Board finds that the Work contains more than a de minimis amount of content generated by artificial intelligence "AI", and this content must therefore be disclaimed in an application for registration. Because Mr. Allen is unwilling to disclaim the AI-generated material, the Work cannot be registered as submitted.10 As AI is increasingly used to generate literature, music, and other forms of art, the U.S. Copyright Office has released new guidance emphasizing whether works, including materials generated by artificial intelligence, exhibit a 'mechanical reproduction' nature or are the 'manifestation of the author's own creative conception'.11The U.S. Copyright Office published a Rule in March 2023 on a range of issues related to the use of AI, where they stated: ...because the Office receives roughly half a million applications for registration each year, it sees new trends in registration activity that may require modifying or expanding the information required to be disclosed on an application. One such recent development is the use of sophisticated artificial intelligence "AI" technologies capable of producing expressive material. These technologies "train" on vast quantities of preexisting human-authored works and use inferences from that training to generate new content. Some systems operate in response to a user's textual instruction, called a "prompt." The resulting output may be textual, visual, or audio, and is determined by the AI based on its design and the material it has been trained on. These technologies, often described as "generative AI," raise questions about whether the material they produce is protected by copyright, whether works consisting of both human-authored and AI-generated material may be registered, and what information should be provided to the Office by applicants seeking to register them.12 The Copyright Office further clarified in a January 2025 that AI-assisted works which the creative expression of the human remains evident in the work can be copyrighted, which can include creative adaption of prompts for AI generators or usage of AI to assist in creation process of a work such asfilmmaking.13Works "where the expressive elements are determine by a machine" still remain uncopyrightable.14Following this guidance, the Copyright Office registered "A Single Piece of American Cheese", the first visual artwork composed solely of AI generated outputs as a composite work in January 2025.15The basis for the copyright involved arguing that human-driven selection, arrangement, and coordination involved in the creative process on a single work constituted sufficient human authorship to merit the copyright. Both the federal and circuit courts in the District of Columbia have upheld the Copyright Office's refusal to register copyrights for works generated solely by machines, establishing that machine ownership would conflict with heritable property rights as establish by the Copyright Act of 1975.16 TheU.S. Patent and Trademark OfficeUSPTO similarly codified restrictions on thepatentabilityof patents credits solely to AI authors in February 2024, following an August 2023 ruling in the caseThaler v. Perlmutter. In this case, the Patent Office denied grant to patents created by Stephen Thaler's AI program,DABUSdue to the lack of a "natural person" on the patents' authorship. TheU.S. Court of Appealsfor the Federal Circuit upheld this decision.1718In the subsequent rule-making, the USPTO allows for human inventors to incorporate the output of artificial intelligence, as long as this method is appropriately documented in the patent application.19However, it may become virtually impossible as when the inner workings and the use of AI in inventive transactions are not adequately understood or are largely unknown.18 RepresentativeAdam Schiffproposed theGenerative AI Copyright Disclosure Actin April 2024. If passed, the bill would require AI companies to submit copyrighted works to theRegister of Copyrightsbefore releasing new generative AI systems. These companies would have to file these documents 30 days before publicly showing their AI tools.20 Other jurisdictions include explicit statutory language related to computer-generated works, including the United Kingdom'sCopyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, which states: In the case of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work which is computer-generated, the author shall be taken to be the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken.7 However, the computer generated work law under UK law relates to autonomous creations by computer programs. Individuals using AI tools will usually be the authors of the works assuming they meet the minimum requirements for copyright work. The language used for computer generated work relates, in respect of AI, to the ability of the human programmers to have copyright in the autonomous productions of the AI tools i.e. where there is no direct human input: In so far as each composite frame is a computer generated work then the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work were undertaken by Mr Jones because he devised the appearance of the various elements of the game and the rules and logic by which each frame is generated and he wrote the relevant computer program. In these circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Jones is the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the works were undertaken and therefore is deemed to be the author by virtue of s.9321 The UK government has consulted on the use of generative tools and AI in respect of intellectual property leading to a proposed specialist Code of Practice:22"to provide guidance to support AI firms to access copyrighted work as an input to their models, whilst ensuring there are protections on generated output to support right holders of copyrighted work".23The U.S. Copyright Office recentlywhen?published anotice of inquiryand request for comments following its 2023 Registration Guidance.24 On November 27, 2023, theBeijingInternet Court issued a decision recognizing copyright in AI-generated images in a litigation.25 As noted by a lawyer and AI art creator, the challenge for intellectual property regulators, legislators and the courts is how to protect human creativity in a technologically neutral fashion whilst considering the risks of automated AI factories. AI tools have the ability to autonomously create a range of material that is potentially subject to copyright music, blogs, poetry, images, and technical papers or other intellectual property rights patents and design rights.9 Deep learning modelssourcelarge data sets from the Internet such as publicly available images and the text of web pages. The text and images are then converted intonumeric formatsthe AI can analyze. A deep learning model identifies patterns linking the encoded text and image data and learns which text concepts correspond to elements in images. Through repetitive testing, the model refines its accuracy by matching images to text descriptions. The trained model undergoes validation to evaluate its skill in generating or manipulating new images using only the text prompts provided after the training process.26When assembling thesetraining datasetsinvolves making copies of copyrighted works, this has raised the question of whether this process infringes the copyright holder's exclusive right to make reproductions of their works, or if it falls usefair useallowances.2728 U.S. machine learning developers have traditionally believed this to be allowable under fair use because using copyrighted work istransformative, and limited.29The situation has been compared toGoogle Books's scanning of copyrighted books inAuthors Guild, Inc. v. Google, Inc., which was ultimately found to be fair use, because the scanned content was not made publicly available, and the use was non-expressive.30 Timothy B. Lee, inArs Technica, argues that if theplaintiffssucceed, this may shift the balance of power in favour of large corporations such as Google, Microsoft, and Meta which can afford to license large amounts of training data from copyright holders and leverage their proprietary datasets of user-generated data.31IPscholars Bryan Casey andMark Lemleyargue in theTexas Law Reviewthat datasets are so large that "there is no plausible option simply to license all of the data.... So allowing any generative training copyright claim is tantamount to saying, not that copyright owners will get paid, but that the use won't be permitted at all."32Other scholars disagree; some predict a similar outcome to the U.S.music licensingprocedures.29 One of the earliest case to challenge the nature of fair use for training AI was a lawsuit thatThomson Reutersbrought against Ross Intelligence first filed in 2020. Thomson Reuters argued that Ross Intelligence had used theirWestlawheadnotes, brief summaries of court decisions, to train their AI engine designed to compete with Westlaw. While Thomson Reuters' claims were initially denied by judgeStephanos Bibasof theThird Circuiton the basis that headnotes may not have been copyrightable, Bibas reevaluated his decision in February 2025 and issued a ruling favoring Thomson Reuters, in that headnotes are copyrightable, and that Ross Intelligence, which had since closed down in 2021, had inappropriately used the material. In the case of Ross's AI, the engine was not generative, and produced output that was composed of pieces of Westlaw's material, which aided in Thomson Reuter's claims of reuse, so how the case may apply to other generative AI like OpenAI is not clear.33 In a consolidated case brought by several authors against Meta and OpenAI, federal district judgeVince Chhabriaexpressed doubt that the use of unlicensed copyrighted material for training AI would fall under fair use. He stated during court hearings to Meta's lawyers that "You have companies using copyright-protected material to create a product that is capable of producing an infinite number of competing products. You are dramatically changing, you might even say obliterating, the market for that person's work, and you're saying that you don't even have to pay a license to that person. I just don't understand how that can be fair use."34 In the EU, such TDM exceptions form part of the 2019Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market.35They are specifically referred to in the EU'sAI Actwhich came into force in 2024, which "is widely seen as a clear indication of the EU legislators intention that the exception covers AI data collection", a view that was also endorsed in a 2024 German court decision.36Unlike the TDM exception for scientific research, the more general exception covering commercial AI only applies if the copyright holder has not opted out.36In order to facilitate the opt-out to the TDM exception, the EU's AI Act of 2024 requires providers of "general-purpose" AI models to implement a policy to comply with EU law including the TDM exception opt-out and to publish a detailed summary of training content according to a template provided by the AI Office. These provisions will come into force in August 2025, with further clarification on exactly what will be required to providers of general-purpose AI models expected to come from a Code of Practice to be released in advance of this.37 Unlike the EU, the United Kingdom prohibits data mining for commercial purposes but has proposed this should be changed to support the development of AI: "For text and data mining, we plan to introduce a new copyright and database exception which allows TDM for any purpose. Rights holders will still have safeguards to protect their content, including a requirement for lawful access."38 Indian copyright law provides fair use exceptions for scientific research, but lacks specific provisions for commercial AI training models. Unlike the EU and UK, India has not established text and data mining TDM provisions that explicitly address commercial AI systems. This regulatory uncertainty became apparent in 2024 whenAsian News InternationalANI sued OpenAI for using its content to train AI models without authorization. While OpenAI offered an opt-out policy that ANI used in October 2024 to block AIscrapers, ANI claimed this measure was ineffective since their content remained available throughcontent syndication. The case also highlighted jurisdictional challenges, as OpenAI argued it was not subject to Indian law because its servers and training operations were located outside the country.3940 In some cases, deep learning models may replicate items in their training set when generating output. This behaviour is generally considered an undesiredoverfittingof a model by AI developers, and has in previous generations of AI been considered a manageable problem.42Memorizationis the emergent phenomenon of LLMs to repeat long strings of training data, and it is no longer related to overfitting.43Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data focused onGPT-2-series models as variously over 1 for exact duplicates44or up to about 7.45This is potentially a security risk and a copyright risk, for both users and providers.46As of August 2023update, major consumer LLMs have attempted to mitigate these problems, but researchers have still been able to prompt leakage of copyrighted material.47 Under U.S. law, to prove that an AI output infringes a copyright, a plaintiff must show the copyrighted work was "actually copied", meaning that the AI generates output which is "substantially similar" to their work, and that the AI had access to their work.4 In the course of learning to statistically model the data on which they are trained, deep generative AI models may learn to imitate the distinct style of particular authors in the training set. Sincefictional characters enjoy some copyright protectionin the U.S. and other jurisdictions, an AI may also produce infringing content in the form of novel works which incorporate fictional characters.441 A generative image model such as Stable Diffusion is able to model the stylistic characteristics of an artist likePablo Picassoincluding his particular brush strokes, use of colour, perspective, and so on, and a user can engineer a prompt such as "an astronaut riding a horse, by Picasso" to cause the model to generate a novel image applying the artist's style to an arbitrary subject. However, an artist's overall style is generally not subject to copyright protection.4Additional questions related to the copyrightability of style and the output of AI models was raised in March 2025, following an update to ChatGPT's model that was able to produce images strongly resembling the work ofStudio Ghibli's artistHayao Miyazaki. While users initially used it to make "Ghiblification" of popular meme images, further users were found to be distasteful in light of Miyazaki's negative stance on AI, and ChatGPT placed limits on the ability for users to make images in the style of living artists.4849 TITLE: Artificial intelligence and copyright - Wikipedia
