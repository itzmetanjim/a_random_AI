In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.123 As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new, research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries. AI programs are being applied to practices such asdiagnostics,4treatment protocoldevelopment,5drug development,6personalized medicine,7andpatient monitoringand care.8Sinceradiographsare the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology, the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant.9 Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such asdata privacy, automation of jobs, and amplifying already existingbiases.10Furthermore, new technologies such as AI are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption.11In contrast, there are also several cases where AI has been put to use in healthcare without proper testing.12131415A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic.16Moreover, meta-studies have found that the scientific literature on AI in healthcare often suffers from a lack ofreproducibility.17181920 Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognizing medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy.21Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analysis of masselectronic health recordsEHRs.22AI can help early prediction, for example, ofAlzheimer's diseaseanddementias, by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments.23 Doctors' decision making could also be supported by AI in urgent situations, for example in theemergency department. Here AI algorithms can help prioritize more serious cases and reduce waiting time.Decision support systemsaugmented with AI can offer real-time suggestions and faster data interpretation to aid the decisions made by healthcare professionals.21 In 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates withChatGPT-generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted onReddits rAskDocs.24Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6 of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions taken from an online forum, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship.24Moreover, responses were not graded on the accuracy of medical information, and some have argued that the experiment was not properlyblinded, with the evaluators being coauthors of the study.252627 Recent developments instatistical physics,machine learning, andinferencealgorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches.28Also, the establishment of largehealthcare-related data warehousesof sometimes hundreds of millions of patients provides extensive training data for AI models.29 Electronic health records EHR are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80 of medical practices use EHR, some anticipate the use of artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians.30 One application uses natural language processing NLP to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms.30For example, the term heart attack andmyocardial infarctionmean the same things, but physicians may use one over the other based on personal preferences.30NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed.30Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read.30Other applications useconcept processingto analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details.31 Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's record andpredict a riskfor a disease based on their previous information and family history.32One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts.33This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses.33Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient's data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease.33Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient's information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician's attention and save time.32One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 7072 accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response.34These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years.32Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients.32 Improvements innatural language processingled to the development of algorithms to identifydrug-drug interactionsin medical literature.35363738Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken.39To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers atCarlos III Universityassembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms.40Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were.41Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms.353638 Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns inuser-generated content, especially electronic health records andor adverse event reports.3637Organizations such as theFDA Adverse Event Reporting SystemFAERS and the World Health Organization'sVigiBaseallow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions.42 The increase oftelemedicine, the treatment of patients remotely, has shown the rise of possible AI applications.43AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors.44A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of.44 Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance onchatbots for mental healthcaredoes not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider be it a chat-bot or psychologist, though.45Some examples of these chatbots include Woebot, Earkick and Wysa.464748 Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations.49Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person's regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal.49Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person's privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions.49 AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload. AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks, prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team.50This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services. Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease, showing potential as an initial triage tool.5152Other algorithms have been used in predicting patient mortality, medication effects, and adverse events following treatment foracute coronary syndrome.51Wearables, smartphones, and internet-based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients' cardiac data points, expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital.53A research in 2019 found that AI can be used to predict heart attack with up to 90 accuracy.54Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifyingheart soundsand diagnosingvalvular disease.55Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models, such as limited data onsocial determinants of healthas they pertain tocardiovascular disease.56 A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans. Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is non-inferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms57and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting, reducing both low-value testing and missed diagnoses.58 In cardiovasculartissue engineeringandorganoidstudies, AI is increasingly used to analyze microscopy images, and integrate electrophysiological read outs.59 Medical imagingsuch as X-ray and photography is a commonly used tool indermatology60and thedevelopment of deep learninghas been strongly tied toimage processing. Therefore, there is a natural fit between the dermatology and deep learning. Machine learning learning holds great potential to process these images for better diagnoses.61Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs.62Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images.63Noyan et al. demonstrated aconvolutional neural networkthat achieved 94 accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopicTzanck smearimages.64A concern raised with this work is that it has not engaged with disparities related to skin color or differential treatment of patients with non-white skin tones.65 According to some researchers, AI algorithms have been shown to be more effective than dermatologists at identifying cancer.66However, a 2021 review article found that a majority of papers analyzing the performance of AI algorithms designed for skin cancer classification failed to use external test sets.67Only four research studies were found in which the AI algorithms were tested on clinics, regions, or populations distinct from those it was trained on, and in each of those four studies, the performance of dermatologists was found to be on par with that of the algorithm. Moreover, only one study68was set in the context of a full clinical examination; others were based on interaction through web-apps or online questionnaires, with most based entirely on context-free images of lesions. In this study, it was found that dermatologists significantly outperformed the algorithms. Many articles claiming superior performance of AI algorithms also fail to distinguish between trainees and board-certified dermatologists in their analyses.67 It has also been suggested that AI could be used to automatically evaluate the outcome ofmaxillo-facial surgeryorcleft palatetherapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance.6970 AI can play a role in various facets of the field ofgastroenterology.Endoscopicexams such asesophagogastroduodenoscopiesEGD andcolonoscopiesrely on rapid detection of abnormal tissue. By enhancing these endoscopic procedures with AI, clinicians can more rapidly identify diseases, determine their severity, and visualize blind spots. Early trials in using AI detection systems of earlystomach cancerhave shownsensitivityclose to expert endoscopists.71 AI can assist doctors treatingulcerative colitisin detecting the microscopic activity of the disease in people and predicting when flare-ups will happen. For example, an AI-powered tool was developed to analyse digitised bowel samples biopsies. The tool was able to distinguish with 80 accuracy between samples that showremissionof colitis and those with active disease. It also predicted the risk of a flare-up happening with the same accuracy. These rates of successfully using microscopic disease activity to predict disease flare are similar to the accuracy ofpathologists.7273 Artificial intelligence utilises massive amounts of data to help with predicting illness, prevention, and diagnosis, as well as patient monitoring. In obstetrics, artificial intelligence is utilized in magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and foetal cardiotocography. AI contributes in the resolution of a variety of obstetrical diagnostic issues.74 AI has shown potential in both the laboratory and clinical spheres ofinfectious diseasemedicine.75During theCOVID-19 pandemic, AI has been used for early detection, tracking virus spread and analysing virus behaviour, among other things.76However, there were only a few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the pandemic itself.77 Other applications of AI around infectious diseases includesupport-vector machinesidentifyingantimicrobial resistance, machine learning analysis of blood smears to detectmalaria, and improved point-of-care testing ofLyme diseasebased on antigen detection. Additionally, AI has been investigated for improving diagnosis ofmeningitis,sepsis, andtuberculosis, as well as predicting treatment complications inhepatitis Bandhepatitis Cpatients.75 AI has been used to identify causes of knee pain that doctors miss, that disproportionately affect Black patients.78Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Researchers have conducted a study using a machine-learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain. They proposed that new algorithmic measure ALG-P could potentially enable expanded access to treatments for underserved patients.79 The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis ofAlzheimer's diseaseAD. For diagnostic purposes, machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs.80The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.81Researchers have developed models that rely onconvolutional neural networkswith the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy.82Generative adversarial networksare a form ofdeep learningthat have also performed well in diagnosing AD.83There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets.84They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases. AI has been explored for use incancerdiagnosis, risk stratification, molecular characterization of tumors, and cancer drug discovery. A particular challenge in oncologic care that AI is being developed to address is the ability to accurately predict which treatment protocols will be best suited for each patient based on their individual genetic, molecular, and tumor-based characteristics.85AI has been trialed in cancer diagnostics with the reading of imaging studies andpathologyslides.86 In January 2020,Google DeepMindannounced an algorithm capable of surpassing human experts inbreast cancer detectionin screening scans.8788A number of researchers, includingTrevor Hastie,Joelle Pineau, andRobert Tibshiraniamong others, published a reply claiming that DeepMind's research publication inNaturelacked key details on methodology and code, "effectively undermining its scientific value" and making it impossible for the scientific community to confirm the work.89In theMIT Technology Review, author Benjamin Haibe-Kains characterized DeepMind's work as "an advertisement" having little to do with science.90 In July 2020, it was reported that an AI algorithm developed by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date inidentifyingprostate cancer, with 98 sensitivity and 97 specificity.9192In 2023 a study reported the use of AI forCT-basedradiomicsclassification at grading the aggressiveness of retroperitonealsarcomawith 82 accuracy compared with 44 for lab analysis of biopsies.9394 Artificial intelligence-enhanced technology is being used as an aid in the screening of eye disease and prevention of blindness.95In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of the first medical device to diagnose a specific type of eye disease, diabetic retinopathy using an artificial intelligence algorithm.96Moreover, AI technology may be used to further improve "diagnosis rates" because of the potential to decrease detection time.97 For many diseases,pathologicalanalysis of cells and tissues is considered to be the gold standard of disease diagnosis. Methods ofdigital pathologyallows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed. AI-assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis B,gastric cancer, andcolorectal cancer. AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes.71AI is well-suited for use in low-complexity pathological analysis of large-scalescreeningsamples, such as colorectal orbreast cancerscreening, thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis.99Several deep learning and artificialneural networkmodels have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists,99and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosingmetastaticbreast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone.100Additionally, implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over 12 million for a university center over the course of five years,101though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched. The use ofaugmentedandvirtual realitycould prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI-assisted pathology, as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real-time to a pathologist for more efficient review.99AI also has the potential to identifyhistologicalfindings at levels beyond what the human eye can see,99and has shown the ability to usegenotypicandphenotypicdata to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer.102One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI-assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective, randomized, multi-center controlledtrialsin determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients, highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research.99 Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies.103104AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making, predictive modeling, and business analytics.105There are only a few examples of AI decision support systems that were prospectively assessed on clinical efficacy when used in practice by physicians. But there are cases where the use of these systems yielded a positive effect on treatment choice by physicians.106 In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept.107Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include predictive modelling of diagnosis and treatment outcomes,108chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression.109 Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017.110Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional, ethical and regulatory questions.111Another issue is often with the validity and interpretability of the models. Small training datasets contain bias that is inherited by the models, and compromises the generalizability and stability of these models. Such models may also have the potential to be discriminatory against minority groups that are underrepresented in samples.112 In 2023, US-basedNational Eating Disorders Associationreplaced its humanhelplinestaff with achatbotbut had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it.113114115 AI is being studied within the field ofradiologyto detect and diagnose diseases throughcomputerized tomographyCT andmagnetic resonanceMR imaging.116It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply, or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers.117Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging, though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated.118AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality,119and automatically assessing image quality.120Further research investigating the use of AI innuclear medicinefocuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies.121The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present: 1convolutional neural network-basedanalysis; and 2 utilization ofradiomics.117 AI is also used in breast imaging for analyzing screening mammograms and can participate in improving breast cancer detection rate122as well as reducing radiologist's reading workload. The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in theclinical decision support systems. As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions.116Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation ofbig datain the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of "data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry.130 The following are examples of large companies that have contributed to AI algorithms for use in healthcare: Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solutionbuzzword to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus and value capturing mechanisms e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders. IFlyteklaunched a service robot "Xiao Man", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH "Cruzr" andSoftbankRobotics "Pepper". The Indian startupHaptikrecently developed aWhatsAppchatbot which answers questions associated with the deadlycoronavirusinIndia. Similarly, a software platformChatBotin partnership withmedtechstartupInfermedica launchedCOVID-19Risk Assessment ChatBot.133 With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies.130Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well.130Companies such asBMW,GE,Tesla,Toyota, andVolvoall have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances.130 Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public. Many new technology companies such asSpaceXand theRaspberry Pi Foundationhave enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before.134With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not.134 Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient.135The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries.135 While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may nonetheless introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such asalgorithmic bias,Do not resuscitateimplications, and othermachine moralityissues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection.136These challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need forregulations. AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval. Depending on the phase of study, international consensus-based reporting guidelines TRIPODAI,137DECIDE-AI,138CONSORT-AI139 have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported. Currently, there are regulations pertaining to the collection of patient data. This includes policies such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA and the European General Data Protection Regulation GDPR.140The GDPR pertains to patients within the EU and details the consent requirements for patient data use when entities collect patient healthcare data. Similarly, HIPAA protects healthcare data from patient records in the United States.140In May 2016, theWhite Houseannounced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of theNational Science and Technology CouncilNSTC Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development within government and academia. The report notes a strategic RD plan for the subfield ofhealth information technologyis in development stages. There is concern that large language models can overwhelm people with both accurate health information and also misinformation, leading to potential challenges in public health. This calls for the need for policy and user guidance related to health information through AI.141 The jointITU-WHOFocus Group on Artificial Intelligence for HealthFG-AI4H has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHOAI for Health Framework- for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions. In January 2021, theUSFDApublished a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence AI Machine Learning ML-Based Software as a Medical Device SaMD Action Plan.143This plan lays out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software. There are five main actions the FDA plans to take to increase regulation: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for AiM:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice GMLP, 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias  Robustness, and 5. Real-World PerformanceRWP. This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Office for Civil Rights OCR has issued guidance on theethical use of AIin healthcare. The guidance outlines four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. Moreover, as of March 2021, the OCR hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer OCAIO to pursue the "implementation of the HHS AI strategy".144The OCR also has issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals health information. These regulations require healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI. The OCR also requires healthcare providers to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. Overall, the U.S. has taken steps to protect individuals privacy and ethical issues related to AI in healthcare145 The U.S. is not the only country to develop or initiate regulations of data privacy with AI. Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on Data Ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity. The importance of human dignity is stressed, as it is said to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes146 The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency.147With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy.147In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications.148 In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63 of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology.140The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare. Furthermore, the lack of current regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data, such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain. For example,Roche, a Swiss healthcare company, was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately 2 million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of 1.9 billion.149Naturally, this generates questions of ethical concern; Is there a monetary price that can be set for data, and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science? Is it fair to patients to sell their data? These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by thePew Research Centerin 2022 that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives, and the survey estimated that 37 of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence, with 8 of participants specifically associating their concern with "people misusing AI".150Ultimately, the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by concerns about mismanagement of data collected, especially in the United States. A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic.16 According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35 of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years.151However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction.151 Automation can provide benefits alongside doctors as well. Some believe that AI may avert healthcare worker burnout and cognitive overload, so that doctors who take advantage of AI in healthcare will provide greater quality healthcare than doctors and medical establishments who do not.152 Recently, there have been many discussions between healthcare experts in terms of AI and elder care. In relation to elder care, AI bots have been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand153 Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care.154A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed usingmany-to-manymapping.155 There can also be unintended bias in these algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities.154Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. For instance, if populations are less represented in healthcare data it is likely to create bias in AI tools that lead to incorrect assumptions of a demographic and impact the ability to provide appropriate care.156White males are overly represented in medical data sets.157Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations.158Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients.157In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes e.g., resolution vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult.159However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data. A final source ofalgorithmic bias, which has been called "label choice bias", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients.160Solutions to the "label choice bias" aim to match the actual target what the algorithm is predicting more closely to the ideal target what researchers want the algorithm to predict, so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program. Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, orexpert system, known asDendral.161162While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent systemMYCIN,163considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine.163164MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however.165 The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians.166Approaches involvingfuzzy settheory,167Bayesian networks,168andartificial neural networks,169170have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: TITLE: Artificial intelligence in healthcare - Wikipedia
