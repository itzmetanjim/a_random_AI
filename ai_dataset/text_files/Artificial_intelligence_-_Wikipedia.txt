It is afield of researchincomputer sciencethat develops and studies methods andsoftwarethat enable machines toperceive their environmentand uselearningandintelligenceto take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.1Such machines may be called AIs. High-profileapplications of AIinclude advancedweb search enginese.g.,Google Search;recommendation systemsused byYouTube,Amazon, andNetflix;virtual assistantse.g.,Google Assistant,Siri, andAlexa;autonomous vehiclese.g.,Waymo;generativeandcreativetools e.g.,ChatGPTandAI art; andsuperhumanplay and analysis instrategy gamese.g.,chessandGo. However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it'snot labeled AI anymore."23 Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning,reasoning,knowledge representation,planning,natural language processing,perception, and support forrobotics.aGeneral intelligencethe ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal levelis among the field's long-term goals.4To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, includingsearchandmathematical optimization,formal logic,artificial neural networks, and methods based onstatistics,operations research, andeconomics.bAI also draws uponpsychology,linguistics,philosophy,neuroscience, and other fields.5 Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,6and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughoutits history,78followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known asAI winters.910Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 whendeep learningoutperformed previous AI techniques.11This growth accelerated further after 2017 with thetransformer architecture,12and by the early 2020s many billions of dollars were being invested in AI and the field experienced rapid ongoingprogressin what has become known as theAI boom. The emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst of the AI boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about therisks of AIandits long-term effectsin the future, prompting discussions aboutregulatory policiesto ensure thesafety and benefits of the technology. The general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.a Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logicaldeductions.13By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing withuncertainor incomplete information, employing concepts fromprobabilityandeconomics.14 Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.15Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.16Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representationandknowledge engineering17allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,18scene interpretation,19clinical decision support,20knowledge discovery mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from largedatabases,21and other areas.22 Aknowledge baseis a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. Anontologyis the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.23Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;24situations, events, states, and time;25causes and effects;26knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know;27default reasoningthings that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing;28and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous;29and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally.16There is also the difficulty ofknowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.c An "agent" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. Arational agenthas goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.d32Inautomated planning, the agent has a specific goal.33Inautomated decision-making, the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation called the "utility" that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the "expected utility": theutilityof all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.34 Inclassical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.35In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is "unknown" or "unobservable" and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not "deterministic". It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.36 In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned e.g., withinverse reinforcement learning, or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.37Information value theorycan be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.38The space of possible future actions and situations is typicallyintractablylarge, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. AMarkov decision processhas atransition modelthat describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and areward functionthat supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. Apolicyassociates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated e.g., byiteration, beheuristic, or it can be learned.39 Game theorydescribes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.40 Machine learningis the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.41It has been a part of AI from the beginning.e There are several kinds of machine learning.Unsupervised learninganalyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.44Supervised learningrequires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties:classificationwhere the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in andregressionwhere the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input.45 Inreinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good".46Transfer learningis when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.47Deep learningis a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspiredartificial neural networksfor all of these types of learning.48 Computational learning theorycan assess learners bycomputational complexity, bysample complexityhow much data is required, or by other notions ofoptimization.49 Natural language processingNLP50allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such asEnglish. Specific problems includespeech recognition,speech synthesis,machine translation,information extraction,information retrievalandquestion answering.51 Early work, based onNoam Chomsky'sgenerative grammarandsemantic networks, had difficulty withword-sense disambiguationfunless restricted to small domains called "micro-worlds" due to the common sense knowledge problem29.Margaret Mastermanbelieved that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and thatthesauriand not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP includeword embeddingrepresenting words, typically asvectorsencoding their meaning,52transformersa deep learning architecture using anattentionmechanism,53and others.54In 2019,generative pre-trained transformeror "GPT" language models began to generate coherent text,5556and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on thebar exam,SATtest,GREtest, and many other real-world applications.57 Machine perceptionis the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, activelidar, sonar, radar, andtactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world.Computer visionis the ability to analyze visual input.58 The field includesspeech recognition,59image classification,60facial recognition,object recognition,61object tracking,62androbotic perception.63 Affective computingis a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate humanfeeling, emotion, and mood.65For example, somevirtual assistantsare programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitatehumancomputer interaction. However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.66Moderate successes related to affective computing include textualsentiment analysisand, more recently,multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.67 A machine withartificial general intelligenceshould be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar tohuman intelligence.4 AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.b AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.68There are two very different kinds of search used in AI:state space searchandlocal search. State space searchsearches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.69For example,planningalgorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process calledmeans-ends analysis.70 Simple exhaustive searches71are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: thesearch spacethe number of places to search quickly grows toastronomical numbers. The result is a search that istoo slowor never completes.15"Heuristics" or "rules of thumb" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.72 Adversarial searchis used forgame-playingprograms, such as chess or Go. It searches through atreeof possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.73 Local searchusesmathematical optimizationto find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.74 Gradient descentis a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize aloss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to trainneural networks,75through thebackpropagationalgorithm. Another type of local search isevolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by "mutating" and "recombining" them,selectingonly the fittest to survive each generation.76 Distributed search processes can coordinate viaswarm intelligencealgorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search areparticle swarm optimizationinspired by birdflocking andant colony optimizationinspired byant trails.77 Formallogicis used forreasoningandknowledge representation.78Formal logic comes in two main forms:propositional logicwhich operates on statements that are true or false and useslogical connectivessuch as "and", "or", "not" and "implies"79andpredicate logicwhich also operates on objects, predicates and relations and usesquantifierssuch as "EveryXis aY" and "There aresomeXs that areYs".80 Deductive reasoningin logic is the process ofprovinga new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true thepremises.81Proofs can be structured as prooftrees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes byinference rules. Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whoseleaf nodesare labelled by premises oraxioms. In the case ofHorn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoningforwardsfrom the premises orbackwardsfrom the problem.82In the more general case of the clausal form offirst-order logic,resolutionis a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.83 Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic isundecidable, and thereforeintractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in thelogic programminglanguageProlog, isTuring complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in othersymbolic programminglanguages.84 Fuzzy logicassigns a "degree of truth" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.85 Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming withnegation as failure, are designed to handledefault reasoning.28Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Many problems in AI including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods fromprobabilitytheory and economics.86Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, usingdecision theory,decision analysis,87andinformation value theory.88These tools include models such asMarkov decision processes,89dynamicdecision networks,90game theoryandmechanism design.91 Bayesian networks92are a tool that can be used forreasoningusing theBayesian inferencealgorithm,g94learningusing theexpectationmaximization algorithm,h96planningusingdecision networks97andperceptionusingdynamic Bayesian networks.90 Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time e.g.,hidden Markov modelsorKalman filters.90 The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers e.g., "if shiny then diamond", on one hand, and controllers e.g., "if diamond then pick up", on the other hand.Classifiers98are functions that usepattern matchingto determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples usingsupervised learning. Each pattern also called an "observation" is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as adata set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.45 There are many kinds of classifiers in use.99Thedecision treeis the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.100K-nearest neighboralgorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, andKernel methodssuch as thesupport vector machineSVM displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.101Thenaive Bayes classifieris reportedly the "most widely used learner"102at Google, due in part to its scalability.103Neural networksare also used as classifiers.104 An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known asartificial neurons, which loosely model theneuronsin a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once theweightcrosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.104 Learning algorithms for neural networks uselocal searchto choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is thebackpropagationalgorithm.105Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs andfind patternsin data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.106 Infeedforward neural networksthe signal passes in only one direction.107Recurrent neural networksfeed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events.Long short term memoryis the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.108Perceptrons109use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning110uses multiple layers.Convolutional neural networksstrengthen the connection between neurons that are "close" to each otherthis is especially important inimage processing, where a local set of neurons mustidentify an "edge"before the network can identify an object.111 Deep learning110uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, inimage processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.112 Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, includingcomputer vision,speech recognition,natural language processing,image classification,113and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021.114The sudden success of deep learning in 20122015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950sibut because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching toGPUs and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giantcurated datasetsused for benchmark testing, such asImageNet.j Generative pre-trained transformersGPT arelarge language modelsLLMs that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a largecorpus of textthat can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the nexttokena token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation. Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique calledreinforcement learning from human feedbackRLHF. Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called "hallucinations", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used inchatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.122123 Current models and services includeGeminiformerly Bard,ChatGPT,Grok,Claude,Copilot, andLLaMA.124MultimodalGPT models can process different types of data modalities such as images, videos, sound, and text.125 In the late 2010s,graphics processing unitsGPUs that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specializedTensorFlowsoftware had replaced previously usedcentral processing unitCPUs as the dominant means for large-scale commercial and academicmachine learningmodels' training.126Specializedprogramming languagessuch asPrologwere used in early AI research,127butgeneral-purpose programming languageslikePythonhave become predominant.128 The transistor density inintegrated circuitshas been observed to roughly double every 18 monthsa trend known asMoore's law, named after theIntelco-founderGordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements inGPUshave been even faster,129a trend sometimes calledHuang's law,130named afterNvidiaco-founder and CEOJensen Huang. AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including:search enginessuch asGoogle Search,targeting online advertisements,recommendation systemsoffered byNetflix,YouTubeorAmazon, drivinginternet traffic,targeted advertisingAdSense,Facebook,virtual assistantssuch asSiriorAlexa,autonomous vehiclesincludingdrones,ADASandself-driving cars,automatic language translationMicrosoft Translator,Google Translate,facial recognitionApple'sFace IDorMicrosoft'sDeepFaceandGoogle'sFaceNet andimage labelingused byFacebook, Apple'siPhotoandTikTok. The deployment of AI may be overseen by aChief automation officerCAO. The application of AI inmedicineandmedical researchhas the potential to increase patient care and quality of life.131Through the lens of theHippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.132133 For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integratingbig data. This is particularly important fororganoidandtissue engineeringdevelopment which usemicroscopyimaging as a key technique in fabrication.134It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research.134135New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example,AlphaFold 22021 demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3Dstructure of a protein.136In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.137In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search forParkinson's diseasedrug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, ofalpha-synucleinthe protein that characterises Parkinson's disease. They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.138139 Game playingprograms have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques.140Deep Bluebecame the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion,Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.141In 2011, in aJeopardy!quiz showexhibition match,IBM'squestion answering system,Watson, defeated the two greatestJeopardy!champions,Brad RutterandKen Jennings, by a significant margin.142In March 2016,AlphaGowon 4 out of 5 games ofGoin a match with Go championLee Sedol, becoming the firstcomputer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player withouthandicaps. Then, in 2017, itdefeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world.143Other programs handleimperfect-informationgames, such as thepoker-playing programPluribus.144DeepMinddeveloped increasingly generalisticreinforcement learningmodels, such as withMuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, orAtarigames.145In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level inStarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.146In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStationGran Turismocompetition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.147In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseenopen-worldvideo games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.148 Large language models, such asGPT-4,Gemini,Claude,LLaMaorMistral, are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form ofhallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such assupervisedfine-tuning149or trainedclassifierswith human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections.150A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.151One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correctreasoningsteps, rather than just the correct result.152TheAlibaba Groupdeveloped a version of itsQwenmodels calledQwen2-Math, that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84 accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems.153In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the techniquerStar-Maththat leveragesMonte Carlo tree searchand step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model likeQwen-7Bto solve 53 of theAIME2024 and 90 of the MATH benchmark problems.154 Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such asAlphaTensor,AlphaGeometryandAlphaProofall fromGoogle DeepMind,155LlemmafromEleutherAI156orJulius.157 When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such asLeanto define mathematical tasks. Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.158 Topological deep learningintegrates varioustopologicalapproaches. Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated "robot advisers" have been in use for some years.159 According to Nicolas Firzli, director of theWorld Pensions  Investments Forum, it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that "the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of e.g., sophisticated pension innovation."160 Various countries are deploying AI military applications.161The main applications enhancecommand and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability.162Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous andautonomous vehicles.161AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions,target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributedJoint Firesbetween networked combat vehicles, both human operated andautonomous.162 AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine.161163164165 Generative artificial intelligenceGenerative AI, GenAI,166or GAI is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data.167168169These modelslearnthe underlying patterns and structures of theirtraining dataand use them to produce new data170171based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural languageprompts.172173 Generative AI tools have become more common since an "AI boom" in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements intransformer-baseddeepneural networks, particularlylarge language modelsLLMs. Major tools includechatbotssuch asChatGPT,DeepSeek,Copilot,Gemini, andLLaMA;text-to-imageartificial intelligence image generationsystems such asStable Diffusion,Midjourney, andDALL-E; andtext-to-videoAI generators such asSora.174175176177Technology companies developing generative AI includeOpenAI,Anthropic,Microsoft,Google,DeepSeek, andBaidu.178179180 Artificial intelligent AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, includingvirtual assistants,chatbots,autonomous vehicles,game-playing systems, andindustrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.184185186 Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction,187AI-integrated sex toys e.g.,teledildonics,188AI-generated sexual education content,189and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners e.g.,Replika.190AI is also used for the production of non-consensualdeepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.191 AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identifyonline gender-based violenceand onlinesexual groomingof minors.192193 There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated "AI" in some offerings or processes.194A few examples areenergy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions,foreign policy, or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation anddisastermanagement are growing. AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Further, AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions.195196197 In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conductpredictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights." For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. During the2024 Indian elections, US50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creatingdeepfakesof allied including sometimes deceased politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.198 AI has potential benefits and potential risks.199AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems:Demis HassabisofDeepMindhopes to "solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else".200However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.201In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.202 Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns aboutprivacy,surveillanceandcopyright. AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio.203For example, in order to buildspeech recognitionalgorithms,Amazonhas recorded millions of private conversations and allowedtemporary workersto listen to and transcribe some of them.204Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as anecessary evilto those for whom it is clearlyunethicaland a violation of theright to privacy.205 AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such asdata aggregation,de-identificationanddifferential privacy.206Since 2016, some privacy experts, such asCynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms offairness.Brian Christianwrote that experts have pivoted "from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'."207 Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of "fair use". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include "the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work" and "the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work".208209Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a "robots.txt" file.210In 2023, leading authors includingJohn GrishamandJonathan Franzen sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.211212Another discussed approach is to envision a separatesui generissystem of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.213 The commercial AI scene is dominated byBig Techcompanies such asAlphabet Inc.,Amazon,Apple Inc.,Meta Platforms, andMicrosoft.214215216Some of these players already own the vast majority of existingcloud infrastructureandcomputingpower fromdata centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.217218 In January 2024, theInternational Energy AgencyIEA releasedElectricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use.219This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.220 Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources  from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that  in the long view  AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and "intelligent", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.221 A 2024Goldman SachsResearch Paper,AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found "US power demand is likely to experience growth not seen in a generation...." and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8 of US power, as opposed to 3 in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.222Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.223 In 2024, theWall Street Journalreported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for 650 Million US.224NvidiaCEOJen-Hsun Huangsaid nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.225 In September 2024,Microsoftannounced an agreement withConstellation Energyto re-open theThree Mile Islandnuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100 of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the USNuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant, over 835 megawatts of power  enough for 800,000 homes  of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at 1.6 billion US and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 USInflation Reduction Act.226The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost 2 billion US to reopen thePalisades Nuclearreactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO ofExelonwho was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation.227 After the last approval in September 2023,Taiwansuspended the approval of data centers north ofTaoyuanwith a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.228Taiwan aims tophase out nuclear powerby 2025.228On the other hand,Singaporeimposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.228 Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024Bloombergarticle in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.229Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.229 On 1 November 2024, theFederal Energy Regulatory CommissionFERC rejected an application submitted byTalen Energyfor approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power stationSusquehannato Amazon's data center.230According to the Commission ChairmanWillie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.230 In 2025 a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated thegreenhouse gas emissionsfrom the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300-500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5 of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5 of the energy sector emissions, butrebound effectsfor example if people will pass from public transport to autonomous cars can reduce it.231 YouTube,Facebookand others userecommender systemsto guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal ofmaximizinguser engagement that is, the only goal was to keep people watching. The AI learned that users tended to choosemisinformation,conspiracy theories, and extremepartisancontent, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people intofilter bubbleswhere they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.232This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.233The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.234 In 2022,generative AIbegan to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films, or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda.235One such potential malicious use is deepfakes forcomputational propaganda236. AI pioneerGeoffrey Hintonexpressed concern about AI enabling "authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates" on a large scale, among other risks.237 Machine learning applications will bebiasedkif they learn from biased data.239The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.240Bias can be introduced by the waytraining datais selected and by the way a model is deployed.241239If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriouslyharmpeople as it can inmedicine,finance,recruitment,housingorpolicing then the algorithm may causediscrimination.242The field offairnessstudies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On June 28, 2015,Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as "gorillas" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,243a problem called "sample size disparity".244Google "fixed" this problem by preventing the system from labellinganythingas a "gorilla". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.245 COMPASis a commercial program widely used byU.S. courtsto assess the likelihood of adefendantbecoming arecidivist. In 2016,Julia AngwinatProPublicadiscovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61, the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.246In 2017, several researcherslshowed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.248 A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature such as "race" or "gender". The feature will correlate with other features like "address", "shopping history" or "first name", and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on "race" or "gender".249Moritz Hardt said "the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work."250 Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make "predictions" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions asrecommendations, some of these "recommendations" will likely be racist.251Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will bebetterthan the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.m Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4 are black and 20 are women.244 There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category isdistributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negativestereotypesor render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict withanti-discrimination laws.238 At its 2022Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and TransparencyACM FAccT 2022, theAssociation for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.dubiousdiscuss253 Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.254Particularly withdeep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linearrelationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.255 It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with aruleras "cancerous", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.256Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at "low risk" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.257 People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.258Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union'sGeneral Data Protection Regulationin 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.nIndustry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.259 DARPAestablished theXAI"Explainable Artificial Intelligence" program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.260 Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.261LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.262Multitask learningprovides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.263Deconvolution,DeepDreamand othergenerativemethods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.264Forgenerative pre-trained transformers,Anthropicdeveloped a technique based ondictionary learningthat associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.265 Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful tobad actors, such asauthoritarian governments,terrorists,criminalsorrogue states. A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.oWidely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentiallyweapons of mass destruction.267Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentiallykill an innocent person.267In 2014, 30 nations including China supported a ban on autonomous weapons under theUnited Nations'Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however theUnited Statesand others disagreed.268By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.269 AI tools make it easier forauthoritarian governmentsto efficiently control their citizens in several ways.Faceandvoice recognitionallow widespreadsurveillance.Machine learning, operating this data, canclassifypotential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding.Recommendation systemscan precisely targetpropagandaandmisinformationfor maximum effect.Deepfakesandgenerative AIaid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritariancentralized decision makingmore competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such asmarkets. It lowers the cost and difficulty ofdigital warfareandadvanced spyware.270All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlierAIfacial recognition systemsare already being used formass surveillancein China.271272 There many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.273 Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.274 In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that "we're in uncharted territory" with AI.275A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-termunemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit ifproductivitygains areredistributed.276Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne andCarl Benedikt Freyestimated 47 of U.S. jobs are at "high risk" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9 of U.S. jobs as "high risk".p278The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.274In April 2023, it was reported that 70 of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.279280 Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence;The Economiststated in 2015 that "the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously".281Jobs at extreme risk range fromparalegalsto fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.282 From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward byJoseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.283 It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicistStephen Hawkingstated, "spell the end of the human race".284This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like "self-awareness" or "sentience" or "consciousness" and becomes a malevolent character.qThese sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-likesentienceto be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. PhilosopherNick Bostromargued that if one givesalmost anygoal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it he used the example of apaperclip factory manager.286Stuart Russellgives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead."287In order to be safe for humanity, asuperintelligencewould have to be genuinelyalignedwith humanity's morality and values so that it is "fundamentally on our side".288 Second,Yuval Noah Harariargues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things likeideologies,law,government,moneyand theeconomyare built onlanguage; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence ofmisinformationsuggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.289 The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.290Personalities such asStephen Hawking,Bill Gates, andElon Musk,291as well as AI pioneers such asYoshua Bengio,Stuart Russell,Demis Hassabis, andSam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023,Geoffrey Hintonannounced his resignation from Google in order to be able to "freely speak out about the risks of AI" without "considering how this impacts Google".292He notably mentioned risks of anAI takeover,293and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.294 In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsedthe joint statementthat "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war".295 Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneerJürgen Schmidhuberdid not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95 of all cases, AI research is about making "human lives longer and healthier and easier."296While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, "they can also be used against the bad actors."297298Andrew Ngalso argued that "it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AIand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests."299Yann LeCun"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction."300In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.301However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.302 Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans.Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.303 Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.304The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,304and was founded at anAAAIsymposium in 2005.305 Other approaches includeWendell Wallach's "artificial moral agents"306andStuart J. Russell'sthree principlesfor developing provably beneficial machines.307 Active organizations in the AI open-source community includeHugging Face,308Google,309EleutherAIandMeta.310Various AI models, such asLlama 2,MistralorStable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,311312meaning that their architecture and trained parameters the "weights" are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freelyfine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.313Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities such as the potential to drastically facilitatebioterrorism and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.314 Artificial Intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by theAlan Turing Instituteand based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows:315316 Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during theAsilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;317however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regards to the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks.318 Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.319 TheUK AI Safety Institutereleased in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under a MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.320 The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.321The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.322According to AI Index atStanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.323324Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.325Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.325TheGlobal Partnership on Artificial Intelligencewas launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.325Henry Kissinger,Eric Schmidt, andDaniel Huttenlocherpublished a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.326In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.327In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics.328In 2024, theCouncil of Europecreated the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the "Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.329 In a 2022Ipsossurvey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78 of Chinese citizens, but only 35 of Americans, agreed that "products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks".323A 2023ReutersIpsos poll found that 61 of Americans agree, and 22 disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.330In a 2023Fox Newspoll, 35 of Americans thought it "very important", and an additional 41 thought it "somewhat important", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13 responding "not very important" and 8 responding "not at all important".331332 In November 2023, the first globalAI Safety Summitwas held inBletchley Parkin the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.33328 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.334335In May 2024 at theAI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.336337 The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly toAlan Turing'stheory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.339340This, along with concurrent discoveries incybernetics,information theoryandneurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an "electronic brain".rThey developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,342such asMcCullouchandPittsdesign for "artificial neurons" in 1943,115and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced theTuring testand showed that "machine intelligence" was plausible.343340 The field of AI research was founded ata workshopatDartmouth Collegein 1956.s6The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.tThey and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":ucomputers were learningcheckersstrategies, solving word problems in algebra, provinglogical theoremsand speaking English.v7Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.340 Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine withgeneral intelligenceand considered this the goal of their field.347In 1965Herbert Simonpredicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do".348In 1967Marvin Minskyagreed, writing that "within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved".349They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.wIn 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to thecriticismofSir James Lighthill351and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress tofund more productive projects.352Minsky's andPapert's bookPerceptronswas understood as proving thatartificial neural networkswould never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.353The "AI winter", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.9 In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success ofexpert systems,354a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan'sfifth generation computerproject inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding foracademic research.8However, beginning with the collapse of theLisp Machinemarket in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.10 Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-levelsymbolsto representmental objectslike plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especiallyperception,robotics,learningandpattern recognition,355and began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches.356Rodney Brooksrejected "representation" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.xJudea Pearl,Lofti Zadeh, and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.86361But the most important development was the revival of "connectionism", including neural network research, byGeoffrey Hintonand others.362In 1990,Yann LeCunsuccessfully showed thatconvolutional neural networkscan recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.363 AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This "narrow" and "formal" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields such asstatistics,economicsandmathematics.364By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as "artificial intelligence" a tendency known as theAI effect.365However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield ofartificial general intelligenceor "AGI", which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.4 Deep learningbegan to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.11For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.yDeep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements faster computers,367graphics processing units,cloud computing368 and access tolarge amounts of data369including curated datasets,368such asImageNet. Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.zThe amount of machine learning research measured by total publications increased by 50 in the years 20152019.325 In 2016, issues offairnessand the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. Thealignment problembecame a serious field of academic study.302 In the late 2010s and early 2020s,AGIcompanies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015,AlphaGo, developed byDeepMind, beat the world championGo player. The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself.GPT-3is alarge language modelthat was released in 2020 byOpenAIand is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.370ChatGPT, launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.371It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness.372These programs, and others, inspired an aggressiveAI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about 50 billion annually was invested in "AI" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20 of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in "AI".373About 800,000 "AI"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.374According to PitchBook research, 22 of newly fundedstartupsin 2024 claimed to be AI companies.375 Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.376Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.377Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such asepistemologyandfree will.378Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy andethics of AI.377 Alan Turingwrote in 1950 "I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?"379He advised changing the question from whether a machine "thinks", to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour".379He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.343Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is "actually" thinking or literally has a "mind". Turing notes thatwe can not determine these things about other peoplebut "it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks."380 RussellandNorvigagree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.1However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. "Aeronautical engineeringtexts", they wrote, "do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly likepigeonsthat they can fool other pigeons.'"382AI founderJohn McCarthyagreed, writing that "Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence".383 McCarthy defines intelligence as "the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world".384Another AI founder,Marvin Minsky, similarly describes it as "the ability to solve hard problems".385The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.1These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the "intelligence" of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google,386a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. Some authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI,387with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketingbuzzword, often even if they did "not actually use AI in a material way".388 No established unifying theory orparadigmhas guided AI research for most of its history.aaThe unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term "artificial intelligence" to mean "machine learning with neural networks". This approach is mostlysub-symbolic,softandnarrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. Symbolic AIor "GOFAI"390simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at "intelligent" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed thephysical symbol systems hypothesis: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action."391 However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning.Moravec's paradoxis the discovery that high-level "intelligent" tasks were easy for AI, but low level "instinctive" tasks were extremely difficult.392PhilosopherHubert Dreyfushadarguedsince the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a "feel" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.393Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.ab16 The issue is not resolved:sub-symbolicreasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such asalgorithmic bias. Critics such asNoam Chomskyargue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,395396in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away fromexplainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field ofneuro-symbolic artificial intelligenceattempts to bridge the two approaches. "Neats" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles such aslogic,optimization, orneural networks. "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,397but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both. Finding a provably correct or optimal solution isintractablefor many important problems.15Soft computing is a set of techniques, includinggenetic algorithms,fuzzy logicand neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence andsuperintelligencedirectly or to solve as many specific problems as possible narrow AI in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.398399General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Thephilosophy of minddoes not know whether a machine can have amind,consciousnessandmental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence.RussellandNorvigadd that "the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on."400However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue inartificial intelligence in fiction. David Chalmersidentified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the "hard" and "easy" problems of consciousness.401The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how thisfeelsor why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion. While humaninformation processingis easy to explain, humansubjective experienceis difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person toknow what red looks like.402 Computationalism is the position in thephilosophy of mindthat the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to themindbody problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophersJerry FodorandHilary Putnam.403 PhilosopherJohn Searlecharacterized this position as "strong AI": "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."acSearle challenges this claim with hisChinese roomargument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.407 It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advancedAI is sentienthas the ability to feel, and if so, to what degree.408But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.409410Sapiencea set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment orself-awareness may provide another moral basis for AI rights.409Robot rightsare also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.411 In 2017, the European Union considered granting "electronic personhood" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.412Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance ofhuman rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.413414 Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be amoral blind spotanalogous toslaveryorfactory farming, which could lead tolarge-scale sufferingif sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.410409 Asuperintelligenceis a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.399If research intoartificial general intelligenceproduced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able toreprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to whatI. J. Goodcalled an "intelligence explosion" andVernor Vingecalled a "singularity".415 However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow anS-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.416 Robot designerHans Moravec, cyberneticistKevin Warwickand inventorRay Kurzweilhave predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future intocyborgsthat are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings ofAldous HuxleyandRobert Ettinger.417 Edward Fredkinargues that "artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution", an idea first proposed bySamuel Butler's "Darwin among the Machines" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon byGeorge Dysonin his 1998 bookDarwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.418 Arguments fordecomputinghave been raised byDan McQuillanResisting AI: An Anti-fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence, 2022, meaning an opposition to the sweeping application and expansion of artificial intelligence. Similar todegrowth, the approach criticizes AI as an outgrowth of the systemic issues and capitalist world we live in. It argues that a different future is possible, in which distance between people is reduced rather than increased through AI intermediaries.419 Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,420and have been a persistent theme inscience fiction.421 A commontropein these works began withMary Shelley'sFrankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works asArthur C. Clarke'sandStanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odysseyboth 1968, withHAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of theDiscovery Onespaceship, as well asThe Terminator1984 andThe Matrix1999. In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort fromThe Day the Earth Stood Still1951 and Bishop fromAliens1986 are less prominent in popular culture.422 Isaac Asimovintroduced theThree Laws of Roboticsin many stories, most notably with the "Multivac" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;423while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.424 Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that havethe ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears inKarel Čapek'sR.U.R., the filmsA.I. Artificial IntelligenceandEx Machina, as well as the novelDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, byPhilip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.425 The two most widely used textbooks in 2023 see theOpen Syllabus: The four most widely used AI textbooks in 2008: Other textbooks: TITLE: Artificial intelligence - Wikipedia
